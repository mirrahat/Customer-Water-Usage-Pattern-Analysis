# Water\*Consumption_Analysis&\_Forecasting

Overview
This project analyzes potable water consumption trends across suburbs and forecasts future demand using deep learning (LSTM). It also includes data visualization and geospatial mapping to provide insights for better water resource management.

Dataset
Potable Water Consumption by Suburb (2018-2024) [CSV]

Suburb Boundaries GeoJSON â€“ Used for geospatial visualization.

Key Analyses & Features-

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Yearly trends in water consumption.
-Identification of high vs. low consumption suburbs.

Correlation between suburb area size (Shape\_\_Area) and water usage.

-Geospatial Visualization (Mapping Water Usage)

Interactive choropleth map showing suburb-wise water consumption.

-Heatmaps of high-demand areas.

Time Series Forecasting (LSTM Model)

-Predicts future water consumption trends for better planning.

-Helps in identifying potential water shortages.
